    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great breakfast (with slight modifications)! First time I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted great but I thought maple syrup and cocoa were unnecessary if using sweetened chocolate milk. Now I also make it without vanilla extract, and cannot tell a difference. Adding just under 1 cup of milk makes it less soggy, which I prefer. So now my ideal recipe is just oats, chia seeds, unsweetened coconut shreds, and chocolate milk. I pre-pack several snack zip locks of the dry ingredients, and take them with me on every vacation.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chocolate-flavored almond milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup old-fashioned rolled oats (such a Quaker®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed shredded sweetened coconut</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix almond milk, oats, chia seeds, coconut, maple syrup, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract in a 12-ounce mason jar.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Stir and serve cold.</li>
    </ol>
