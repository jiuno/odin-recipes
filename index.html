    <h1>Chocolate Coconut Overnight Oats</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great breakfast (with slight modifications)! First time I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted great but I thought maple syrup and cocoa were unnecessary if using sweetened chocolate milk. Now I also make it without vanilla extract, and cannot tell a difference. Adding just under 1 cup of milk makes it less soggy, which I prefer. So now my ideal recipe is just oats, chia seeds, unsweetened coconut shreds, and chocolate milk. I pre-pack several snack zip locks of the dry ingredients, and take them with me on every vacation.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chocolate-flavored almond milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup old-fashioned rolled oats (such a Quaker®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed shredded sweetened coconut</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
